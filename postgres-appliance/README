Docker image to run the postgres appliance.

It consists of PostgreSQL itself, managed by governor,
and etcd proxy.


At the moment, is just a dockerized version of HA template:
https://github.com/compose/governor
with dependencies installed.

This is an early stage image not meant for production yet. 

One can run a HA cluster with 3 nodes using senza, i.e.

senza create spilo.yaml cluster_name etcd_discovery_url docker_image_path:version,
i.e. to create a cluster called lambda:

senza create spilo.yaml lambda etcd.acid.example.com yourname/spilo:0.6-SNAPSHOT
