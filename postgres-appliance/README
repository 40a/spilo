Docker image to run the postgres appliance.

It consists of PostgreSQL itself, managed by governor,
etcd proxy and haproxy.

At the moment, etcd is a stand-alone service (and not a proxy),
and haproxy is not used altogether (although installed on the machine).

At the moment, is just a dockerized version of HA template:
https://github.com/compose/governor
with dependencies installed.

This is an early stage image not meant for production yet.
