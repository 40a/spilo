Docker image to run the postgres appliance.

It consists of PostgreSQL itself, managed by governor,
and etcd proxy.


At the moment, is just a dockerized version of HA template:
https://github.com/compose/governor
with dependencies installed.

This is an early stage image not meant for production yet.
