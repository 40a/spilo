TODO items:

- initialize the appliance with certain parameters,
  like the cluster name and the adddress of etcd.
  Use those parameters when configuring the governor,
  and etcd-proxy.

- run etcd proxy instead of full-scale etcd

- configure haproxy to fetch information from
  the etcd-proxy and point to the acting master

- use WAL-E to ship backups and WAL segments to S3

- ship PostgreSQL logs somewhere (TBD)

Out of scope for the docker appliance:

- launch the auto-scaling group on AWS, create DNS names

- create S3 buckets and related instance profiles for WAL-E

- mount extrernal storage (EBS or SSD) to a certain directory
  in Docker
