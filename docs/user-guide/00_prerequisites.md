You will need a VPC and be allowed to create new infrastructure.

To deploy spilo to AWS you will need the tooling from [stups](http://stups.readthedocs.org/en/latest).
The gist of it is to:

* have an AWS account with enough rights for deployment
* install Python 3.4
* install `stups-mai`
* install `stups-senza`

Before going any further ensure you can login to your VPC using the `stups` tooling.
